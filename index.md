# About Me

I'm a software engineer from Boston, MA with 10+ years of experience developing software and leading teams. I currently work in a microservice environment writing C# code to integrate subsystems, plan inbound and outbound product flow, measure and predict system state, and assign tasks to robots at a warehouse automation company.

# Work Experience

## Symbotic (2010 - Present)

[Symbotic](http://symbotic.com) designs and builds complete hardware and software solutions for automating the storage and retrieval of inventory in warehouses using robots.

I currently lead the Architecture Support Team which is responsible for the overall software architecture including technology choices, business requirement analysis and breakdown into service design, all infrastructure and DevOps responsibilities, developer productivity, and review and governance of all service development.

I am also the technical lead of the Platform Development team responsible for implementation of shared infrastructure, services, libraries, tools and the implementation of development standards used by all developers throughout the organization.

My roles have included being an individual contributor as a software engineer, a scrum master, a product owner, a technical lead and a software architect (at both a component level, and at the department level). I have led multiple teams at a time, ranging in size from 3-18 developers, primarily as a technical lead, and also with several direct reports (both employees and remote contractors).

Over the years, I have personally contributed to over 15 different applications, over 10 shared libraries, and many other artifacts used throughout the software development organization.
